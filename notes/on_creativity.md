# Creativity

> In my book the word “creativity” only means “forming an idea into the real world.” —— Zed Shaw

> The only difference between me—a supposedly very creative person—and you is that I’ve practiced taking ideas I have and making them real. I keep a notebook of ideas and try to implement them regularly. I study painting, music, writing, and programming as a means of implementing and crafting my thoughts into realities. By simply attempting to create something on a regular basis I’ve become adept at doing it, and there is no magic to this. I just keep trying until I can do it.

> The trick to being a productive creative person is learning to implement your ideas inside a process or set of constraints that guides you on a path of learning but avoiding the trap of a strict process that kills your creativity.
